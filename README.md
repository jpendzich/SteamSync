This program is supposed to replace the Steam Cloud for games that do not support it such as Fallout 3. It is primarily supposed to be used with the Steam Deck in the future 

# TODO
 - Rework networking package and serialization (encoding package go std library)
 - Rework the whole idea from Server and Client to only Client and only an optional Server
 - Rework UI and make it more accessible (Clients will search for other Clients on the network)
 - Maybe make a decky loader plugin
